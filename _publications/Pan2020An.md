permalink: /publication/2020-08-01-Pan2020An
excerpt: 'An ultra-low-power attitude module is the ultimate target for the majority of Medical Engineering. In this paper, we present an ultra-low-power attitude angular estimation module solution, which integrates accelerator and zigbee chip. Firstly, different from common solutions, our angle module merely assists with an accelerator. Secondly, the attitude angles are derived from the gravity vector. Thirdly, considering the characteristics of the practical projects, some heuristic rules are used to further reduce the consumption. The working power of our module is only 3.43mW, which is dramatically lower than other the state-of-the-arts solutions. Besides, massive experiments show that the lasting time is more than a week, which is always in the work state and persists in sending the data of attitude angles. Finally, in order to verify its actual performance in the application, we also deploy proposed solution in the sleep caring system of mental patients, especially for sleep. At the same time, we publish our demonstration video and source code with the aim of being a reference solution for researchers.Video - https://youtu.be/hgfoW1TdI8oSource code - https://github.com/ZhuChaozheng/person_pose_est imator.'
